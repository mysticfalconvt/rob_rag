I couldn’t find a specific purchase price for the boat in the documents you provided. The **Boat Bill of Sale** lists fields for “VESSEL price” and other amounts, but those values are missing or garbled (e.g., it shows “VESSEL price{Zeccd”). The repair invoice totals $732.69, which is just the cost of services and parts, not the original purchase price.

So, based on the available documents, I can’t determine how much the boat itself was purchased for. If you have a copy of the bill of sale with the vessel price filled in or another receipt that shows the purchase amount, feel free to share it and I’ll be happy to help interpret it.

Great, I read the document and it shows that the boat was sold for $20,000

Got it—thanks for clarifying! According to the bill of sale you reviewed, the vessel was purchased for **$20 000**. If you need help with anything else (e.g., calculating depreciation, tax implications, or any other related questions), just let me know!
